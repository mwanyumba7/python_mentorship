## Week One :man_technologist:

On the first week we had a great session on Introduction to Python and relly learnt a lot from our great mentor [Harun Mbaabu](https://twitter.com/HarunMbaabu). He shared with us great insigths on the python learning road map. 
His practical and hands on approach into the learning of python went a long way to helping us grasp all the begginer python concepts in a very east way.
Here is the link to the session that was livestreamed on Lux Academy YouTube page. Be sure to subcribe for more such great events!

The project for week 1 , which is already available in the repository (week1_project.py) , was to create a python function that when you inputs a number the function you have
created checks whether the number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence or not.

We were also expected to write a techinical article on on the first week. The article was to be on the subject [**"Python 101: Introduction to Modern Python"**](https://dev.to/brayan_kai/python-101-introduction-to-modern-python-2757)

I will be more than glad it you could take time and read the article. Don't hesitate to lave a comment in the comments section of the [article](https://dev.to/brayan_kai/python-101-introduction-to-modern-python-2757).

## Week Two :man_technologist:

In the second week of the the Python Mentorship program , we had a great session with [@VeldaKiara](https://twitter.com/VeldaKiara) on Intermediate Modern Python. With Velda's excellent delivery skills and real world experience on coding with Python, we were able to gain the most out of her talk. Conceptualizing on every concept she explained.

Here also is the link to the session on Lux Academy YouTube page.

The Project for week 2 , which is already available on the repository (week2_project), was to Write a python program that checks whether a year is leap year or not. You were required to make use of nested if...else to solve this problem.

In week two we were expected to write an article on the subject [**"Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms with Python"**](https://dev.to/brayan_kai/introduction-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-with-python-3jhn)

## Week Three Hurray! :tada:

The third and last week at last, we are here finally. A long journey that we started by a single step has finally paid off :clap:.

On the third week we had an amazing session with [@HarunMbaabu](https://twitter.com/HarunMbaabu) on Advanced Python concepts. We really learnt a lot from Harun and we just have to practice the concepts and put them into practice.

Here is the link to the session on Lux Academy YouTube channel. Be sure to subscribe for such great events.

The Project for week 2 , which is already available on the repository (week3_project), was using Python we create an application that downloads images and videos from Instagram, building your interface using any web framework of your choice. 

In week three we were also expected to write a technical article on [**"Python for everyone: Mastering Python The Right Way"**](https://dev.to/brayan_kai/mastering-python-the-right-way-2gi)
